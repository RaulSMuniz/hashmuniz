A simple tic-tac-toe game done with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game has a smooth and responsive gameplay, having an intuitive interface. It is a perfect choice to play against a friend, being good for passing time and testing your strategic skills.

Features:
- When the game ends, a one-second fade-in animation was set for a smooth transition.
- The game has a responsive interface, providing a pleasant gameplay on both desktop and mobile.
- It has a clear victory and draw indication, thus indicating to the user when and how the game ended.
- There is a 'Restart Game' option when the game ends, allowing the user to quickly restart the game. This function can only be accessed when the game ends.
- As the old style tic-tac-toe game, it has an intuive and gameplay. The user only has to click on a cell to play, alternating between 'X' and 'O'.

Enhanced Skills:
During the development of this game, a few of my technical skills were further enhanced:
- My HTML & CSS structuring techniques were improved, allowing the game to be more responsive and to have better visuals.
- On JavaScript, my programming logic was heavily improved, also enhancing my 2d array manipulation. This allowed the game to have an interactive gameplay, which includes the victory and draw checking conditions.
- Also as a part of my CSS technique, I've started to delve into CSS animations. The specific animation is 'fade-in forwards', allowing the game to have a smooth transition when it ends.

It must be noted that when the user clicks on 'Iniciar Jogo', the button disappears. This also allows the user to have an immersive gameplay.

After the game ends, it has three variations:
